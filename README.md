# Deep Sea Fish Farming Simulation

A comprehensive simulation system for deep sea fish farming, incorporating pressure control, environmental monitoring, and investment tracking.

Local fishing workforce lower intake and receive kickbacks while letting fish populations resurface, and sensible vouchers for investment with Tuna at $1,000,000+ a pop...

Sea health & weather readings for realistic populations and UAV release and maintenance provide further jobs.

## Components

### 1. Pressure Tank System
- Static weight hanger system for pressure control
- Pressure gradient simulation
- Faraday cage for magnetic field control for fish sanity & spawning
- Multi-level pressure lock system

### 2. Environmental Monitoring
- Water composition analysis
- Waste management system
- Temperature and pressure sensors
- Magnetic field control

### 3. Fish Behavior Tracking
- Schooling pattern analysis
- Stress level monitoring
- Feeding behavior tracking
- Growth rate measurement

### 4. Investment System
- Fish stock tracking
- Local fishermen keep flavor and population by sending back readings
- Annuity calculations
- Distribution management
- ROI projections

## Hardware Requirements
